Hi, I am Bruno, a Software engineer from Hungary. 

I acquired my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Szeged, and currently I am studying Mechatronics Engineering (Master's Degree).

I am interested in multiple topics, like electronics, embedded devices, 3D printing. My BSc thesis was designing and making an STM32 based portable oscilloscope module
that can be used with smartphones (I developed the STM32 program and the Android application too).

I worked mostly with C, but I am familiar with C++, C# and Java too. Also, as I said, I really love 3D printing, so that make me fall in love with 3D design (I mostly used Fusion 360 and AutoCAD).
And most importantly, I have built multiple 3D printers, the most recent one is 100% designed and built by me (and even most part of it are made by me).

I worked a bit in automotive field (electronic steering), but I am really interested in medical devices, robotics and industry 4.0, so I could imagine a future career for myself
in any of them.

Currently I am looking for work near Budapest, but I might be move in the future.
Feel free to contact me, if I might had an opportunity to work with you:
