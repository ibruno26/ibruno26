Hi, 

I am Bruno, a Software engineer from Hungary. 

I acquired my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering at University of Szeged, and currently I am working as a Software Engineer at AVL Hungary.

I am interested in multiple topics, like electronics, embedded devices, 3D printing. My BSc thesis was designing and making an STM32 based portable oscilloscope module
that can be used with smartphones (I developed the STM32 program and the Android application too).

I work mostly with C and Simulink, but I am familiar with C++ too. Also, as I said, I really love 3D printing, so that make me fall in love with 3D design (I mostly used Fusion 360 and AutoCAD).
And most importantly, I have built multiple 3D printers, the most recent one is 100% designed and built by me (and even most part of it are made by me).
